# Smartphone-Based Detection of Abnormal Lung Sounds Using Domain Adaptive Deep Learning

This repository contains the official source code and implementation for the paper: "Smartphone-based detection of abnormal lung sounds using domain adaptive deep learning".

This work presents a deep learning framework designed to adapt models trained on high-quality electronic stethoscope data for robust deployment on consumer-grade smartphones. Our goal is to enable accessible, remote screening for pediatric respiratory abnormalities.
